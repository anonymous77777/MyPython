the eventual goal of this assignment is to compute the total number of ways of forming a collection of committees from an academic department of n professors.
The first task is to write a function called committee to compute the number of ways of forming a single committee with r members from a collection of n people. This is the same as computing the number of ways of choosing r people out of n to sit at the first of two tables, and is therefore n!/(r!*(n-r)!) by the reasoning given in the zyLab in section 6.18 on seating a large group at multiple tables. Make sure the function returns an integer, not a floating point number with a decimal point.
